# React + Vite
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

1. Initially we were doing locally data added into ProductList.jsx file then we pass data from api as mention below:-
-> using json-server (package)-> tool which is used to create dummy REST API's quickly without any backend support(like: node.js) and easily.
-- > To run the json-server use cmd = json-server --watch data.json --port 8000

2. To sort a prince check json-server package use query like (?_sort=price&order=desc) etc.
